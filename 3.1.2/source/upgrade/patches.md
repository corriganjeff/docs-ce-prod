# Gluu Server Patches

## OPENDJ-2969 
### February 15, 2019

### Affected versions
- All Gluu versions (2.x - 3.x), any installation using Gluu OpenDJ

### Description

OpenDJ 3.0 is affected by bug preventing replication server component from successfully starting if its DB's certain changelog (binary) files are of size of multiply of 256. More info on the [OpenDJ jira](https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENDJ-2969).

Upgrading to a fixed 3.5 package version isn't yet possible at the time of writting due to licensing. The only possible workaround is to rename/remove the `changeDBlog/` dir before starting OpenDJ's JVM. Thus a workaround was developed by the Gluu Team in attempt to mitigate its impact, which automates the process and does it transparenlty to an user.

### Steps to Fix

#### Patching steps

Follow next steps to apply the patch:

1. All work should be done inside Gluu-Server container. 

1. Put patching script at `/usr/local/sbin/check_changelog.sh` (see source code of it below)   

1. Edit `/opt/opendj/bin/start-ds` script by adding section calling the patch script to the beginning of it (see diff below for clues)    
1. Set proper permissions for the patch script: `# chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/check_changelog.sh; chown ldap:ldap /usr/local/sbin/check_changelog.sh`

When service is started/restarted, if unsafe condition is detected, script will rename the current `changeDBlog/` dir to `changeDBlog.TIMESTAMP/` and then will allow `start-ds` script to proceed with starting OpenDJ, expecting it to re-create the directory.

#### Patch script's source

```
#!/bin/bash

base=`basename $PWD`
TODAY=`date +%Y%m%d_%H%M`
changeDBlog="/opt/opendj/changelogDb"

date=`date "+%y%m%d-%H%M%S"`

files=`find $changeDBlog -name "head.log" -print` 
for file in $files; do
	size=`ls -l $file | awk '{print $5}'`
	check1=`expr ${size} / 256`
	check2=`expr 256 \* ${check1}`
	if [ "${size}" = "${check2}" -a "${check1}" != "0" ]; then
		echo "ALERT! $file has size as multiple of 256..."
		echo "Renaming $changeDBlog as ${changeDBlog}.$TODAY"
		mv $changeDBlog ${changeDBlog}.$TODAY
		break
	fi
done
echo "Moving towards normal opendj start now..."
```

#### Diff between the modified and original `start-ds` files

```
# diff -c /opt/opendj/bin/start-ds-new /opt/opendj/bin/start-ds

#### An extra precaution to ensure data integrity when impacted by OpenDJ-2969

It is important to compare the amount of entries between all replicated trees of the nodes prior to, and after the steps have been completed. For example, querying the numsubordinates against ou=people on the individual nodes. It is possible that a situation could arise where a significant difference exists between nodeA and nodeB ..., even though there aren't any clear errors in the recent replication log data. In such case, a good practice is to disable/re-enable whole replication operation as part of the patch process. This behavior could occur, for example, if the opendj-2969 issue existed in an environment where multiple restarts have occured beyond the default purge setting for opendj (typically 3 days), and prior to an administrator noticing that a problem existed. In this scenario where a remarkable difference in data quantity expecations exists, it is important to note which node(s) have the most recent data and use those as the new masters when re-initializing secondary master nodes. 

## Publicly viewable oxTrust pages

### January 30, 2019

### Affected Versions 

Gluu Server 3.1.0, 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.3, 3.1.4 

### Description

We discovered the following two pages in oxTrust are not properly protected: 

 - `../identity/status/appliance`
 - `../identity/configuration/registration`

The steps to fix below apply to **all** affected Gluu Server versions. 

### Steps to fix

!!! Note 
    You will need a 5 minute maintenance window for your /identity endpoint to apply the fix.
    
!!! Warning
    We always recommend testing on a non-production environment first.
    

1. Backup your Gluu Server -- either a VM snapshot or a tarball of the gluu-server container. [Read the docs](https://gluu.org/docs/ce/3.1.4/operation/backup/)        

1. Log into your Gluu Server container.              
     For Centos 6.x, Red Hat 6.x, Ubuntu 14/16, and Debian 8:
         `# service gluu-server-3.1.x login`

     For Centos 7.x, Red Hat 7.x and Debian 9:
         `# /sbin/gluu-serverd-3.1.x login`Â 

1. Download the patch script:             
         `wget https://repo.gluu.org/upd/security_patch_identity.py`

1. Run the command:               
         `chmod +x security_patch_identity.py`

1. Run the command:             
         `python security_patch_identity.py` 

1. Open an incognito window in your browser and attempt to access the two affected pages. They should now require authentication.   

## Code White Patch
### August 21, 2018

### Affected versions
- All Gluu versions (2.x, 3.x)

### Description
We have discovered a critical vulnerability in the Jboss Richfaces library. All versions of the component Richfaces (including the latest v4.5.17.Final) are affected by the vulnerability, which is an EL injection leading to Remote Code Execution. The CVE assignment to MITRE for it is CVE-2018-12532. The CVE can be seen on the [MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12532) site as well as [NIST](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12532). 

This vulnerability is basically a bypass of CVE-2015-0279. CVE-2015-0279 hardens the `org.richfaces.resource.MediaOutputResource` class by blocking expressions containing [parantheses](https://github.com/richfaces/richfaces/blob/4.5.17.Final/components/a4j/src/main/java/org/richfaces/resource/MediaOutputResource.java#L67-L69). The new vulnerability lies in the fact that EL additionally made use of custom variable mappers internally to resolve the variable name in case it's not found in the main expression, but variable mappers themselves can contain EL code just the same. Variable mappers are implemented through the `varMapper` field of `org.apache.el.MethodExpressionImpl` in Tomcat EL API, which Jetty is also using.

The general flow looks like this: the application deserializes the "do" parameter (the 'source') at `org.richfaces.resource.ResourceUtils#decodeBytesData`, passes the object through some other calls, and eventually calls a `MethodExpression.invoke` on a field in the object (the 'sink') at `org.richfaces.resource.MediaOutputResource#encode`. There is however a protection in place restricting deserialization to [certain classes](https://github.com/richfaces/richfaces/blob/4.5.17.Final/core/src/main/java/org/richfaces/util/LookAheadObjectInputStream.java#L133), but as the `VariableMapperImpl` class is also whitelisted there, we then have full control over the `varMapper` field in the `MethodExpressionImpl` instance, which essentially means arbitrary EL injection.

As oxTrust/Identity utilizes Jboss Richfaces, this allows an unauthorized user to perform unauthorized Remote Code Execution. Knowing this, we have created a richfaces updater script that removes the affected class from the `identity.war` file, negating the impact of this vulnerability. That being said, we strongly recommend that **oxTrust should not be internet facing.**

### Steps to Fix

!!! Note
    We **strongly** recommend [backing up your environment](../operation/backup.md) before proceeding. 

!!! Note
    The script will suggest you to restart container after the patching is done. This step can be omitted if steps below were followed to the letter, as stopping and starting particular service ("tomcat" for 2.x and "identity" for 3.x) is enough to apply the changes.
    
1. Login to the Gluu Server chroot
1. Download the security patch from [https://repo.gluu.org/upd/richfaces_updater.sh](https://repo.gluu.org/upd/richfaces_updater.sh)
1. Grant `richfaces_updater.sh` executable privileges
1. Stop "tomcat"/"identity" services:

        Gluu Server 3.x: [root@localhost ~]# service identity stop
        Gluu Server 2.x: [root@localhost ~]# service tomcat stop

1. Run `richfaces_updater.sh`

        [root@example ~]# service gluu-server-x.x.x Login
        Welcome to the Gluu Server!
        [root@localhost ~]# chmod +x richfaces_updater.sh 
        [root@localhost ~]# ./richfaces_updater.sh 
        Creating directory /opt/upd
        Verifying archive integrity...  100%   MD5 checksums are OK. All good.
        Uncompressing Gluu Richfaces Updater  100%  

        Backing up /opt/gluu/jetty/identity/webapps/identity.war to /opt/upd/Thu_Aug_16_20:21:50_2018
        Updating /opt/gluu/jetty/identity/webapps/identity.war
        Deleting old richfaces from identity.war
        deleting: WEB-INF/lib/richfaces-4.5.17.Final.jar
        deleting: WEB-INF/lib/richfaces-core-4.5.17.Final.jar
        deleting: WEB-INF/lib/richfaces-a4j-4.5.17.Final.jar
        Adding latest richfaces to identity.war
        adding: WEB-INF/lib/richfaces-4.5.17-gluu.Final.jar (deflated 20%)
        adding: WEB-INF/lib/richfaces-a4j-4.5.17-gluu.Final.jar (deflated 10%)
        adding: WEB-INF/lib/richfaces-core-4.5.17-gluu.Final.jar (deflated 9%)

1. Start "tomcat"/"identity" services:

        Gluu Server 3.x: [root@localhost ~]# service identity start
        Gluu Server 2.x: [root@localhost ~]# service tomcat start

### Explanation of Fix

By following the above instructions, you will replace the old richfaces library in `identity.war` with a custom fixed version for the Gluu Server. The fix is accomplished by removing the affected (and unused) classes from the vulnerable library, negating the impact of the vulnerabiity.

A backup of your `identity.war`, before changes, is in the `/opt/upd/backup_$TIME_STAMP` directory in case you need it.
